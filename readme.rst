simpleMail
==========

I built simplemail because I was tired of having to specify so many options to
smtplib and email just to send myself a simple message!

Usage
=====

You should look at simpleMail.py in the source, and set your options at the top there
accordingly.

If you are using Google, you will need to use a username / password, and generate your
password as an app password.  A link is found in the source.

In the future, I may support a 'config.py', or other configruation options.  For now, 
this works for me. :)

If you have feedback or suggestions, please leave me a message!
